_One night, Snake had a dream. Snake dreamt of a world with unlimited supplies of tasty pixel apples, which was his favorite snack. However, the dream was not a happy one. In this world, a mystical and terrible pool called out for him, promising great rewards, but at the cost of great sacrifice. The strange situation Snake was in made him crawl around in such a pace that walls and even his own body became a lethal threat._

_The pool calls as the dream carries on.._

## Casual Snake and the mystical pool?

This game is a simple and fun take on a [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) with a twist. Casual Snake introduces the concept of a pool that can make things quite interesting.

## How do I control Snake?

Use your arrow keys or swipe if you're using a mobile device.

## I love this game, but it sucks to enter the URL in my mobile phone each time I want to play

Then add it as a desktop entry! :)

## Is there a leaderboard?

Nope, your scores are stored locally in your browser. Screenshots and other ways to brag about your points will have to do.

## Things does not work

That may be because you're using Internet Explorer. This game was developed using Chrome, so you can always try to switch to that browser instead.

# A technical note

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Follow the instructions there if you want to fire up the game after cloning this repo.
